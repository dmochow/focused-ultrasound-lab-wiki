# Laboratory Procedures

This section contains detailed protocols and standard operating procedures for all experimental techniques used in our tFUS-fiber photometry research.

## Core Procedures

### [Surgeries](./surgeries)
Detailed protocols for stereotaxic surgeries, including AAV injections and fiber implantation procedures.

### [Fiber Photometry](./fiber_photometry)
Setup, calibration, and recording protocols for fiber photometry experiments using our Neurophotometrics/TDT system.

### [tFUS Operation](./tFUS)
Operating procedures for transcranial focused ultrasound equipment, including transducer positioning, parameter selection, and safety protocols.

### [Behavior Tasks](./behavior_tasks)
Behavioral paradigms and operant conditioning protocols used in conjunction with neural recordings and tFUS stimulation.

### [Data Analysis](./data_analysis)
Standard analysis pipelines for processing fiber photometry signals, behavioral data, and integrated tFUS-photometry datasets.
